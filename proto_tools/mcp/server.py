Users can choose to deploy tools to their own Modal environments. Deployed tools
retain their model weights between calls in the user's Modal storage, making
subsequent calls fast.

- `list_tools` reports the tools this user has deployed. Pass `deployed_only=false`
  for the full catalogue of deployable tools, which identifies what remains
  available to deploy.

- If a user needs a tool that is deployable but that they have not yet deployed,
  use `deploy_tool`. It prompts the user to confirm before proceeding.

- `deploy_tool` deploys into the Modal environment `workspace_info` reports, which
  users create while setting up their account (the documented name is
  `proto-env`). Pass `environment` only to deploy somewhere else, and ask the user
  first, since a workspace can hold several.

- Any deployed tool can then be run using `run_tool`.

IMPORTANT: Deploying and running tools bills activity to the user's Modal account.

Large outputs, such as predicted structures and embeddings, are written to disk
and returned as file paths rather than being returned inline.

Proto offers limited access to hosted deployments, available to users who hold an
API key. At present, API keys to the Proto service are provided only to a small
set of collaborators.

Begin with `list_tools` to establish what is hosted. Unlike Modal, where the user
deploys tools themselves, the catalogue available through Proto is fixed: do not
propose deploying a tool. Where a tool is unavailable, `run_tool` explains why and
refers to the `modal` backend, which the user would need to configure themselves.

Large outputs, such as predicted structures and embeddings, are written to disk
and returned as file paths rather than inline.

_LOCAL_INSTRUCTIONS = """Run bioinformatics tools on this machine.

Tools execute in this process rather than on a remote backend, so there is nothing
to deploy. Every registered tool is available: begin with `list_tools` to see them.

Each tool builds its own isolated environment and downloads its model weights the
first time it runs, so a first call can take several minutes. Later calls reuse
both and are fast.

A tool that requires a GPU requires one on this machine. Check `workspace_info`
and the tool's description before calling one.
